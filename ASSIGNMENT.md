# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I read the README.md file which explained the purpose of this module very well. I would say the README.md file made it easy to understand and the lack of inline comments would have made it even easier. However, since the code is very simple i was able to quickly understand it. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> "Raise the level of abstraction" means to focus on the purpose of the code and the abstract idea behind it without focusing on the "how". The documentation should tell the reader exactly what's the code they're looking at without going into full details of how the purpose is achieved. That's what I would tell a CS 142 student. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Since the code wasn't hard, It took me about 4 hrs to finish. I spent a lot of time searching for the right package and I took some time to learn how to document using JDOC


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Used Stack Overflow to understand more about API's so I went through many conversation threads.  


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I didn't encounter any main problems that I would raise concern about. But I think for future reference, it would save time to have simple packages available for students who might have problem searching.
